  <p><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In October of 2014, I was blessed to travel for the first time to a magical city,<br>
well two: Paris and Versailles, during the week of my 50th birthday. <br>
I also was able to take around 380 fotos while I was there,<br>
in part to research for the hopeful some day film of my first novel <em>Rebekah's Closet</em>, <br>
which came out in 2011, for which I'm slowly writing the screenplay now.<br>
<br>
I must say also, that, although I did exact research from my novel for locations to visit,<br>
and used the internet to research in advance and once there, as well as the proverbial paper MAPS,<br>
none of this would have the slightest bit possible without the assistance<br>
of <a href="http://www.frenchlinks.com/about.php">French Links Tours</a>, who helped us book our apartment and find our way around town, <br>
 including finding and reserving my 50th birthday dinner restaurant<br>
 personally met us at a cafe in town once we arrived in Paris and guided us to our apartment<br>
  gave us free boat cruise tickets</font><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> and helped us while we were there that week with little things we needed. Kudos!<br>
