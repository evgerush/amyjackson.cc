  <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Philip Metals, Inc. is a metal recycling 
    center in Nashville, Tennessee where I was allowed to photograph, videotape 
    and record sounds before I moved to the DC area in April, 2003. This series 
    of source materials were combined with <a href="../Chiltons/Chiltons.html">Chilton's 
    Industrial Machine Shop</a> stills, video loops and sounds for a multimedia 
    installation in November, 2003 at <a href="http://www.chicnhair.com">Andee 
    Rudloff's Morris Alley Studio</a>, in Bowling Green, Kentucky. TeZ of <a href="http://www.submultimedia.nl/">Submultimedia 
    Labs</a> and <a href="http://www.amyjackson.cc/jasonstelluto/index.html">Jason 
    Stelluto</a> of Windowpane Productions collaborated with me to create this 
    multimedia show, <b><a href="http://www.protoquadro.net/">Unlikely Canvases</a></b>.

  <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Concept: Form is temporary. An everchanging 
    interplay between order and chaos is the norm. We are all returning to the 
    one source of life in our various states of grace, chaos and order. Through 
    a multimedia installation, the viewer will experience a metal recycling center 
    and industrial machine shop where machines are repaired, as the machines and 
    scrap metal are recycled into bits for new life or repaired for an extension 
    of life in their current forms. The heaps of metal and well-worn machines 
    are unlikely canvases which show us a natural poignancy and passion that are 
    like human souls as we are transformed by our life experiences. If you perceive 
    the world as a whole, where nothing is really solid and each entity consists 
    of energy, elements and form, then there really is no distinction between 
    Nature, human beings and machines, that all is Nature. </font></p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our current forms are temporary and we are 
    more at one with the world than we ordinarily perceive. <br>
    The experience of a metal recycling center and an industrial machine repair 
    shop are transformed through photography, video and music into a place where 
    we are connected with the energy all around us. Ordinarily we see machines 
    as destructive, as against Nature, as separate, cold and lifeless. But when 
    the form is not wasted but is respected, and recycled, we are acting in harmony 
    with the natural order and respect for this oneness with Nature. This exhibit 
    demonstrates that everything is an extension of Nature, that Nature includes 
    all creation, that even metal and machines glow with life and can move our 
    souls with their beauty and loss. Nature touches the machines and the metal 
    with her chaos as well as orderly decomposition of the form with rust and 
    decay. Man creates machines and interacts with them with ordered vision as 
    well as random evidence of use, mimicking Nature.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our lives are unlikely canvases, and what 
    would our souls look like if we could see them, not the even form we see every 
    day to put clothes on, but the energy state of our souls? Our souls, underneath 
    all of the coverings of spiritual, mental and emotional fluctuations, are 
    whole and beautiful. Would our souls in the process of transformation, the 
    struggles to release these temporary coverings, resemble these twisted bits 
    of metal that are still beautiful in shape, or evocative upside down? Chaos 
    makes you beautiful. Order makes you beautiful. The smooth as well as the 
    rough. <br>
    </font></p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What man was most afraid of early on was 
    chaos: his stomach was orderly in its need for food, but how to get it was 
    to confront chaos and chance. He learned in part to act with the natural rhythms 
    of life around him, cycles, patterns he could count on. His power over Nature 
    was to bring an illusory order -- to cut down the forest, to have a shaven 
    view, devoid of the chaotic growth of the forest -- but Nature is chaos and 
    can't be totally ordered by the mind or work -- part of the installation is 
    to embrace chaos as part of us and Nature. That there is beauty in chaos as 
    well as order -- to better accept the chaos in ourselves, we embrace ourselves 
    as part of Nature, and we are more likely to survive our own machines.</font></p>
