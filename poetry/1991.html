<P>riddle for the invisible fiddler crab</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>you see me crashing against</P>

<P>myself</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>do you wonder what is sand and where</P>

<P>saltwater?</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>listening to the waves, i wonder myself</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>in my own eyes i have forgotten</P>

<P>hypnotized with horizons</P>

<P>gray-blue in the sun</P>

<P>black-blue sometimes with stars</P>

<P>blurred depths</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>are you pelican or crab?</P>

<P>jellyfish or manta ray?</P>

<P>turtle or human?</P>

<P>woman and man?</P>

<P>a distant shore?</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I can swim, yet burn, and feel buried.</P>

<P>I cannot fly.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>this riddle is my name for now.</P>

<P>Reflections on "Johanna D'Arc de Mongolia," Driving from the
Movie</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>floating along the four-lane late</P>

<P>night and homeward, music and monotony in my skull</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>mongolian nomads raced long horses as grasses grew back before
them</P>

<P>brilliant-hued silks, bursting through the wet outer subway
walls</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>shattering with laughter and wind and sun, cheers and
whistling</P>

<P>amazing me into sudden movement while driving</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>everything is slow as Earth to sand blows quickly into deserts</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>sand rushing into my eyes from their hooves and speeding</P>

<P>scrubbing me of sight to fill my head like an urn</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I shift</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>the nomads cross over me now on their good horses</P>

<P>the princess leads the way and they are shimmering silken
bodies</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I am their desert, near the train, where the Spirit Tree
stands</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
