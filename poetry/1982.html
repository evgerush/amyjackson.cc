<P>We rode a storm together once,</P><P>our hair flying rampant in the wind,</P><P>the raven sky clawing and flapping its wings,</P><P>and croaking, "You don't belong here," with a hiss.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>I was lonely, as were you,</P><P>in a world of realities,</P><P>where no one understood our dreams.</P><P>They didn't know what they had done,</P><P>when they killed you and threw your body away,</P><P>leaving your stump to fade away in lace.</P><P>All I have of you now is that stump,</P><P>gathering silver parasites,</P><P>to stand on when I'm lonely and gazing at</P><P>the heavens,</P><P>when no one understands.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Fall, &copy;1982</P><P><I>The Old Red Kimono</I>, Floyd Junior College</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Amy Jackson</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><A HREF="poetry.html">poetry</A></P><P><A HREF="../index.html">home</A></P><P></P></BODY></HTML>
