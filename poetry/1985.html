<P>"Blest Be the Tie that Binds"</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>She steps, maelstrom surrounded,</P>

<P>infant at breast, quietly taking milk,</P>

<P>head of daughter at her hip, one arm encircling Mama's leg</P>

<P>another reaching into unknown whorls.</P>

<P>Mama clutches in free right hand many overdue bills</P>

<P>eyes fixed ahead, driven, consumed.</P>

<P>Father follows, resentful,</P>

<P>remote control in hand, relaxed</P>

<P>absorbed in the news, waiting for his</P>

<P>supper to fall out of her hands</P>

<P>as it fell from his mother's.</P>

<P>God forbid. She is lucky to have him</P>

<P>at all. She does not feel</P>

<P>lucky. She does not think.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The maelstrom reddens, thickens. She stifles a scream</P>

<P>in her fright, final, surfaced, total.</P>

<P>She falters and turns</P>

<P>to face him. He has no strength to hold, to give ... no eyes. He
blames.</P>

<P>He beats.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Daughter lets go to stand alone, deaf, mute.</P>

<P>They stumble, divided.</P>

<P>The maelstrom rages, unaware.</P>

<P>God forbid; Grace provided.</P>

<P>Trickle down a culture, family, strong,</P>

<P>united.</P>
