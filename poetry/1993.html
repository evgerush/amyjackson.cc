<P>the question of the egg</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>he took the egg</P>

<P>rubbed it between his hands</P>

<P>until the shell was gone</P>

<P>then i was exposed</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>maybe i grew around what was left</P>

<P>until the shape of the egg was lost</P>

<P>in folds of my heart tissue</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>or maybe it drifted in my bloodstream</P>

<P>like a lost craft</P>

<P>a broken plane</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>did it evaporate in the confusion of the</P>

<P>heat of that summer?</P>

<P>disintegrate</P>

<P>and become part of the invisible</P>

<P>everything where dead leaves and</P>

<P>grandparents go?</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>unlike you</P>

<P>who can put the tapes on erase</P>

<P>i am haunted by the ghost of a</P>

<P>small unborn bird</P>

<P>wildly shadowing me</P>

<P>pecking, chirping</P>

<P>telling me</P>

<P>maybe it could have flown?</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Maybe about Taming</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I can't remember which one of you touched my face</P>

<P>it was dark, if you remember</P>

<P>I don't want to be tamed</P>

<P>touch my face in the mirror</P>

<P>cover my own mouth</P>

<P>see if I'll go away like a ghost</P>

<P>my face is a surprise, never matching my inside</P>

<P>I don't know what that means</P>

<P>we were lovers for months and years and still</P>

<P>I couldn't bring my gentlest hand to your face</P>

<P>without you cringing, beaten too many times as a</P>

<P>child, for no good reason</P>

<P>and I shouldn't have said anything the first time</P>

<P>you let me touch your whole face</P>

<P>after that you remembered too much, maybe</P>

<P>Maybe I kind of know how you feel now</P>

<P>I don't want to remember which one of you</P>

<P>touched my face in the dark</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>moon-bone</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>water turned your face to stone</P>

<P>smooth and round as creekbed rocks</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>one of these beads</P>

<P>filled the palm of my hand with white weight</P>

<P>I believe it was your mouth</P>

<P>threaded onto a black leather strip</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>gave it to a little girl with silver eyes</P>

<P>what is is made of? where did it come from?</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>bone, normally a hollow substance and light</P>

<P>has become calcified over time</P>

<P>I found it in the water</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>should've told her it was a piece of the moon</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>your face was always so round and bright</P>

<P>as that</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>beginners' watch, we're</P>

<P>waiting for someone</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>show us the way</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>snowing, delightful, today</P>

<P>wishes and Irish coffee and one slow gray train</P>

<P>it whistled once for us, we thought</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>a man froze to death in the street this morning</P>

<P>we snuggled in separate beds, long distance</P>

<P>waiting</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>show us, build homes</P>

<P>waiting for someone, a man froze</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>it whistled once for us, we thought</P>
