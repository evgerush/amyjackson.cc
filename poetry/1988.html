<P>the night slowly rhythms</P>

<P>an old loving song of its own</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>erratic cat at the window</P>

<P>excited deeply at the filling moon</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>ancient languages tiptoe gingerly</P>

<P>grasp and leap into nighttime</P>

<P>time, words skins make</P>

<P>so briefly in peace with another's</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>carnival</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>it doesn't come often, only once a year</P>

<P>in early May to the parking lot</P>

<P>in front of the abandoned store fronts</P>

<P>of a dying shopping center</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>it consists of mostly red</P>

<P>machines and poorer people afford it</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>except for the man who videotapes</P>

<P>his properly clad lovely wife and</P>

<P>daughter on the stiff merry-go-round</P>

<P>he turns it off to save film when they</P>

<P>leave his frame of reference</P>

<P>choosing not to capture the thin</P>

<P>blond girl waiting for the magic to</P>

<P>hit her on a cold plastic pony</P>

<P>white, with a green garland</P>

<P>painted on its neck</P>

<P>each time she passes before his</P>

<P>waiting smile, her slump is a little</P>

<P>deeper</P>

<P>rounder in the turn of her head</P>

<P>opposite dot on a silly cruel circle</P>

<P>counterclockwise</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>a black man walks softly</P>

<P>in long shorts with a pink sailboat</P>

<P>on them, white striped turquoise</P>

<P>muscle shirt and black sunglasses</P>

<P>brave</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>boys make fun and practice karate</P>

<P>kicks in the air behind</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>him, and his friends fluctuate as if</P>

<P>within his personal cloud eleven</P>

<P>adding weight to his graceful life</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>life, a girl pushes at them</P>

<P>tells them to stop</P>

<P>picking at him behind his</P>

<P>back, making</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>fun, they head toward the swinging</P>

<P>twin bullet ride which will twist their</P>

<P>reality up and down and sideways</P>

<P>and their screams come from the</P>

<P>bullet with the rebel flag attached</P>

<P>flashing clear white bulbs</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>spinning, losing to the machine and</P>

<P>gravity pulled from their insides</P>

<P>they let go with all hands</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>corn dogs and hot dogs</P>

<P>the couple with faded loose clothes</P>

<P>young-old and weary, head to the red</P>

<P>fence to enter, she almost ahead of his</P>

<P>reluctant but complying steps, there is</P>

<P>escape</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>sun streaks out like in</P>

<P>movies about God sending messages</P>

<P>above it all</P>

<P>out of context</P>

<P>outdated symbolically</P>

<P>no one looks up</P>

<P>it returns behind tomorrow's</P>

<P>rain clouds coming in</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>there is only</P>

<P>one little girl on the automobile-go-round</P>

<P>pretending to drive a masculine red truck</P>

<P>instead of the sports car, bus, motorcycle or</P>

<P>sedan, soft and curly brown hair</P>

<P>turning in the wind toward daddy's</P>

<P>face</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>at night it will be</P>

<P>anotherness for them, next week</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>it will be gone.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>lip as petal slow-curling</P>

<P>finish it off, quick</P>

<P>spherical wonder of mouth-surprise</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>you didn't say it out loud for eight years, but</P>

<P>tonight you found the wing-edge of a tongue</P>

<P>nestled warm-dark-soft-red and beating</P>

<P>time to a fault</P>

<P>just behind my ear</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>listen to the staccato-artery, running safely and</P>

<P>wild, back behind the earth they struggle with bones,</P>

<P>finally</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>blue-eyed schizoid words</P>

<P>emit them foul and true</P>

<P>waste your time, full of it,</P>

<P>high-flying dares the flower,</P>

<P>final cut.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>For Once</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>turning onto the interstate, the</P>

<P>overwhelming</P>

<P>dispersing</P>

<P>revelling</P>

<P>quiet sky --</P>

<P>summer shower has spent itself onto the</P>

<P>growing highway, and fragrant gray</P>

<P>cloud-feathers, air-sucked and rent, float,</P>

<P>move without an imposed speed limit or</P>

<P>engine full of dinosaurs, but</P>

<P>flowing, shining white streaks</P>

<P>bursts</P>

<P>ribbons, silver</P>

<P>white</P>

<P>blue and blue for a few moments without the</P>

<P>hot haze of a hovering drought-stricken summer</P>

<P>pollution in a dingy brown band, above it changing</P>

<P>realms of space, and, for once, the freshly wet</P>

<P>highway mirrors magnificence</P>

<P>reflects the atmosphere triumphant</P>

<P>simply there</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>headless praying mantis-like forms of</P>

<P>steel holding wires in a frozen parade,</P>

<P>how we love to imitate</P>

<P>pretend to evolve above and away from</P>

<P>what we destroy</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>in the distance</P>

<P>coming the other way</P>

<P>on the opposite side of a dirty</P>

<P>beige concrete divider</P>

<P>automobiles roll in each others' wet and</P>

<P>steam like disciplined metal pigs,</P>

<P>the pollution rising light-brown</P>

<P>above it a grove of trees</P>

<P>Chattahoochee</P>

<P>receives a rhythmic sky</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>somewhere children stop their gaming to</P>

<P>gaze and dream and see shapes they</P>

<P>cannot create</P>

<P>but i don't know where they are, or when</P>

<P>or why they survive inside of me</P>

<P>with other rhythmic eyes</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>rushed hour, resume safe</P>

<P>speed,</P>

<P>don't look at the sky</P>

<P>look where you're going.</P>

<P>for what it's worth</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>behind the cloud of your own steam you close your mind to
intruders</P>

<P>like your memory of me, my potential as appraised, but that's
ok</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>because the ending was off on both sides even though the
pictures</P>

<P>seemed to be</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>perfect, they have curled and fallen from the wall, with</P>

<P>preview filmstrips flying, unconnected the show abruptly</P>

<P>finished when the director lost</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>interest like a Black Monday in</P>

<P>relationship investment markets, escape behind a cloud of your
own</P>

<P>assets, start your own theme music, make an independent film,
the</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>smoke rolls in through a vent, grandly speechless, it swallows
your</P>

<P>thought in thick, untouchable white.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>the world is crisp and clear-blue-cold.</P>

<P>tribal, the woods echo green with it.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>no war, but you like it played that way,</P>

<P>deafen the sense of your own</P>

<P>rebel, rebel, come outside.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>no one is watching, but me.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>never mind, with your over-speculation</P>

<P>you may never find an equal.</P>

<P>drugstore models wink cardboard eyelids</P>

<P>it's all for sale and clinically proven to reduce</P>

<P>reality to the semblance of youthful perfection</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>stinking steam does not rise, returns to</P>

<P>haunt these back and side streets</P>

<P>of blood and screams</P>

<P>deals of the aching unwise</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>so many dollars through her cigarette-yellowing</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>who would've thought a man with a cello</P>

<P>could disappear so fast on a wet Saturday</P>

<P>street in Atlanta</P>

<P>at noon</P>

<P>with her hands curled inside like knots</P>

<P>flapping like pale ribbons</P>

<P>almost hello, walking behind him</P>

<P>by accident</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>who would have called to him</P>

<P>for the cello curve to turn like a question</P>

<P>and a stranger and said</P>

<P>what? look, I don't know you and I</P>

<P>know you don't know me</P>

<P>or my hands, nor I the touch of your</P>

<P>eyelashes on my stomach</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>a scrap of paper wet and run over in the street</P>

<P>would blow away in the wind tomorrow</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>his movement before her and the</P>

<P>foolishness of fear</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>as if, when they parted of course</P>

<P>when she drove back to that corner next</P>

<P>Saturday he would be there</P>

<P>or anyone would</P>

<P>large-proportioned muscles nor perfect symmetry</P>

<P>not what anyone calls her</P>

<P>her fury is a finger reducing her essence to category</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>sometimes she ever-fleeing turtle-necked poet</P>

<P>writhes upon dream-glass-shards</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>with the outsides of heart he magnet to her</P>

<P>shuddering, calming, tremble-storming cloud-mass</P>

<P>within and upon her, search secrets' interiors</P>

<P>non-places, non-times, essence so rude so</P>

<P>light-filled divine, blend colors to onyx polish,</P>

<P>boil to desert-white bone, flight of dynosaur womb</P>

<P>adventure-spirit shared</P>

<P>create and destroy in flame the phoenix eternal</P>

<P>with the back of a fist</P>

<P>the delicacy of form-surface</P>

<P>shatter a menagerie of sheltered dream-creature-flowers</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>out, drifting out afloat</P>

<P>she thinks they're cute, she</P>

<P>feeds them with brand names</P>

<P>dropping from her imaginary</P>

<P>lips because she has no food to</P>

<P>speak of</P>

<P>but she would buy it if she did</P>

<P>she likes to mention Bloomingdales</P>

<P>so</P>

<P>I just stopped licking my face with a wet paw</P>

<P>looked and listened to see if</P>

<P>like the side of your face in the dark</P>

<P>that greasiness of the street and tread of tires
black-clinging</P>

reappearing,</P>

<P>revealing, rebounding with silence, magnetized,</P>

<P>rubbing of opposites</P>
