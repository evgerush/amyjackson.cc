<P>Separating the Things</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>take something back, from this void stage of sound</P>

<P>round your eyes when I spoke and you finally heard</P>

<P>round your eyes I avoided, seeing the ground</P>

<P>up from you, ground up glasses, hourglasses of sugar</P>

<P>and salt we sprinkled like snow, in dreams with</P>

<P>promises that seemed so easy, but true</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>take nothing back, just let the ropes lie, there,</P>

<P>where I let them go, your hands in the air, still</P>

<P>holding on, almost as if the reins and your veins</P>

<P>were the same</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>horses, one obese, one starving, they remember both of</P>

<P>us, with their dark animal soft eyes, back when we</P>

<P>made noises of passion and froth into each other's</P>

<P>steaming manes, chariot races in open spaces and sun</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>drifting, afloat, and I've seen you drowning yourself,</P>

<P>filling your stomach and lungs full of salt water, I</P>

<P>know why, my love, but you can't stop, and gulls came for</P>

<P>crumbs and you stared at them, mumbling your monotony</P>

<P>and I don't know what happened, or why, but I'm in a boat,
too,</P>

<P>my hair dried and salted into cords over my face, you</P>

<P>scream at the gulls sometimes, but they come back, they</P>

<P>have eaten from your hand, and liked it</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>sometimes you are bobbing face down in the waves and I</P>

<P>know you must be dead, but you roll over, so I start wearing</P>

<P>black just in case</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I miss holding your hand when it wasn't a symbol, a</P>

<P>gesture, an apology, but a necessity, foreplay, an</P>

<P>unconscious reaching, finding and safety</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I miss looking in your eyes and understanding the love</P>

<P>we found ourselves warming in, like a home fire, there,</P>

<P>they glazed over like those of the shipwrecked dead,</P>

<P>frozen in terrors you could not describe, shedding dry</P>

<P>salt, filling your hands with glass, snow, crumbs, sugar,</P>

<P>of this I would eat or you would throw all of it at me,</P>

<P>blind, my love, blind</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>your nightmares ruined your days as you fought them</P>

<P>each night in your head, killing them over and over again,</P>

<P>you wouldn't tell me how, and I didn't want to know</P>

<P>i couldn't stand it coming to bed one night and i tried to</P>

<P>calmly wake you from your drunken sleep, and from there your</P>

<P>fist crashed into my jaw, not waking, not waking,</P>

<P>in the morning you were running late for work, hungover,</P>

<P>running from me as I told you what you did</P>

<P>but shock was nothing new, it's where I lived with you</P>

<P>they told me to pack an emergency bag</P>

<P>offered a place to stay</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>my golden boy, my golden man</P>
<P>where have you gone?</P>
<P>why are your drowning now?</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>before we were married, life was a constant debate,</P>

<P>we protested in the snow against foreign policy in El
Salvador,</P>

<P>we read our poetry together as we wrote it and with our
friends,</P>

<P>our minds were on fire with questions and rage about nuclear
arsenals,</P>

<P>and Nietsche became your god, which you didn't like me to say</P>

<P>your professors doted on you, the stack of love letters grew
tall</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I lit the copal and sage spiral sticks with a wooden</P>

<P>match on fire, so simple and quiet, the scent cleared the</P>

<P>air of alcohol fermented through your skins, your</P>

<P>things, books, photos, papers you wrote in eighth grade,</P>

<P>shirts you wore to work in the cotton mill, to do research,</P>

<P>to school, to be married, to go to the beach, to run and</P>

<P>flowers grew again over the bed with new sheets, and</P>

<P>candles flamed tall in stillness without you, and I slowly</P>

<P>began to breathe, but my heart was shell-shocked cold,</P>

<P>the cats curled up with me and we slept for weeks</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>wedding pictures, bright sunshine summer day frozen</P>

<P>drops of joy in a lilac bottle i won't open, hidden in a</P>

<P>drawer with old socks and nightmares that my love has</P>

<P>died, dead, a look I felt on my face when you kissed me</P>

<P>married, welcomed me into our future, the</P>

<P>sun shining through the trees around you and the love</P>

<P>we celebrated with friends and family shyly, a photo</P>

<P>snapped, I can't believe how much your face has changed,</P>

<P>and my own, as I watched years thereafter the poisoning</P>

<P>of all that light</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>when the door was shut between us for real, the ropes</P>

<P>were caught under it, you would come and point at them</P>

<P>and I would take my knife and cut them a little closer</P>

<P>to you, my love I cannot trust, the air is heavy around</P>

<P>you wherever you are, when I remember you I open the</P>

<P>windows wide and light incense and candles in honor of</P>

<P>what little light remains, your hands still fill to throw
things</P>

<P>at me but now you don't because your ears are emptying</P>

<P>of their salt, and I have swept the floor of the debris</P>

<P>you have already thrown at me</P>
