<P>Nose to Earth</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Beneath the night, our murmurings,</P>

<P>touching, searching in the softness and warmth</P>

<P>of skins at moonfall,</P>

<P>we are quiet, foreheads together,</P>

<P>we sleep, we dream.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>You push me away, turn on the bedside light, read.</P>

<P>You do not want to read me, my things, hear my life,</P>

<P>know me, know my body only.</P>

<P>What are you reading, nothing I</P>

<P>just can't sleep, oh, I thought it was me, something.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I dream that I wake to find my heart has stilled and I am the</P>

<P>heart of a mockingbird pecking on the windowpane of you,</P>

<P>snippets of nightsong, gurgling from a sense of featheredness,</P>

<P>fragility, of coming light? any requests? a requiem?</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>And then I hear it, the crunching, grinding of your</P>

<P>teeth, disturbing my dark float</P>

<P>like a poker in the fire of me</P>

<P>a spurt of flames and crackling sparks on my startled</P>

<P>way back up into the bed next to you, a</P>

<P>giant sharpening his teeth</P>

<P>you will not wake to hold me</P>

<P>and I know you would say</P>

<P>leave, if I frighten you so much.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The black wave flows over me again, warm black</P>

<P>oil the fear this night, I run with the cat heart</P>

<P>stalking, you fall and my teeth crunch bone of</P>

<P>neck, blood spurting in my face, the black wave salty</P>

<P>washing us, pulling you dead into the sea with it,</P>

<P>to the depths of itself</P>

<P>I lick my cat paws of your blood</P>

<P>waiting for the images to flicker</P>

<P>before cat eyes at dream windows</P>

<P>the water, the mirror, the surface of the</P>

<P>sky.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>A darker wave of black, thick,</P>

<P>beneath the night the sky is dripping stars</P>

<P>I brush against leaves of jungle growth</P>

<P>nude, dew, moist and cool</P>

<P>healing skin and bones, I curl to sleep</P>

<P>I dig my fingers deep into dark earth, rich,</P>

<P>the small ones living there</P>

<P>worming and scurrying away from the strange</P>

<P>new touch, I roll over and over and down</P>

<P>to a clearing, an oasis, a basin of dark</P>

<P>clear water and wait</P>

<P>camouflaged by the black earth</P>

<P>on my skin, wild dark eyes</P>

<P>hypnotized by the rhythm of the night-</P>

<P>living creatures, croaking and chirping and</P>

<P>screeching, all eyes blazing in the night,</P>

<P>nose to earth, waiting.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>A scream wells up from the darkness of the bed</P>

<P>anger erupting molten rock from beneath the</P>

<P>surface of my sleep, stifled, sickening, I tremble and</P>

<P>wake. I shiver close to where you warmed beside</P>

<P>me; you are there a half second before I wake, no</P>

<P>longer. The bed is ice.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I wander down for the</P>

<P>freshness of the sun</P>

<P>the mockingbirdsong of</P>

<P>morning is nonsense, gibberish;</P>

<P>the cat on the windowsill, sleeping.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Scar</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Scar, white,</P>

<P>and hard:</P>

<P>inside me there is always</P>

<P>that place, stiff,</P>

<P>numb, paralyzed ...</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>He gave me that scar.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>beneath the scar</P>

<P>inside</P>

<P>there is a dry</P>

<P>ripping, burning, wrenching</P>

<P>pounding rhythm.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The screams of pure anger and hatred</P>

<P>have not surfaced, or passed.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I am left behind with that</P>

<P>bloodless white</P>

<P>scar,</P>

<P>what bleeds</P>

<P>beneath.</P>

<P>She Flies</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>They try to catch the tips of her buttery-soft wings with their
fingers</P>

<P>she is quick in her mystery, in her fear</P>

<P>with a net he comes saturdays and he sees her world</P>

<P>this is the only field left in all of america</P>

<P>with his net to catch her, to watch her die in an empty pickle</P>

<P>jar without holes, empty except for her and a cotton ball soaked
in alcohol</P>

<P>because he is an amateur</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>old white house with a screened-in front porch and a rose garden
used to</P>

<P>used to be here, he used to see it, condemned, on his way in to
work</P>

<P>fighting for home, between radio commercials wondering who
grew</P>

<P>up there</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>roses still bloom and die, defiant, in the overgrown grasses
choke</P>

<P>yellow roses, once he gave a woman roses, yellow roses</P>

<P>she said yellow ones meant friendship and kissed him on the
cheek</P>

<P>buried her face in the petals to look pretty</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>she drinks nectar, golden pollen on her black legs, a feast, only
a few</P>

<P>hesitant buds not yet unfolding in the sun</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>he doesn't think twice, net, jar</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>up close (a fantasy)</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>earth of your eyes</P>

<P>calm mind a river</P>

<P>heart a boat, your</P>

<P>breath warm wind</P>

<P>so soft the valley</P>

<P>of your back, I float.</P>
