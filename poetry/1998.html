<P>stream one</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>becoming part of the stream</P>

<P>is to become part of the breath</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>the words don't stop</P>

<P>coming through</P>

<P>they float and spark on the highway</P>

<P>with the red cigarette trails at night</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>like a painting that has escaped to three</P>

<P>new lives before you are done painting it</P>

<P>and even then it wanted you to stop</P>

<P>before you were done</P>

<P>insisting that even one stroke was enough</P>

<P>but you want to stretch it out</P>

<P>pin it to the paper, thin</P>

<P>uninterrupted chameleon skin</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>like Burroughs with his scissors</P>

<P>cutting up the words</P>

<P>throwing them up in the air</P>

<P>to fall, to pick to choose to recombine</P>

<P>combinations of combinations</P>

<P>cutting up the painting</P>

<P>and finding a <A HREF="../watercolors/torso.html">torso</A></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>conversation circles rollercoasters</P>

<P>iced tea strawberries</P>

<P>ice cream and ham</P>

<P>glazed lemons</P>

<P>fried spam</P>

<P>lemon balm and fresh wounds</P>

<P>cariopteris blue and silver</P>

<P>purple lifestream</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>within and within</P>

<P>uniform and random apples</P>

<P>wutherings</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>tumbleweed words</P>

<P>tethered only as chance</P>

<P>is tethered to time</P>

<P>and infinity</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>frog decibels</P>

<P>serenading irony</P>

<P>bird on a wire</P>

<P>ennui</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>it's a joke</P>

<P>is not a joke</P>

<P>it's a joke again</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>flip-flopping palabras penumbras</P>

<P>conundrums calculators</P>

<P>gentian swings</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>the redbud blooms purple</P>

<P>misnamed from the beginning</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>it's purple</P>

<P>when all the cars are turning white</P>

<P>because white is cheaper in the long run</P>

<P>it won't even stay</P>

<P>purple</P>

<P>and today the cars</P>

<P>were mostly versions of red</P>

<P>four people wore the same</P>

<P>exact color to work</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>it listens, and redefines itself constantly</P>

<P>yet its core dna chip reads the same string of code</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>it is a dance of contraposition and ecstasy</P>

<P>and surprise</P>

<P>the richness of words and chance order</P>

<P>license plate numbers, vowels</P>

<P>metric and dynaflow measurements</P>

<P>formulas for baby's milk, nuclear freeze</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>it is the spiral of the waves around us</P>

<P>the interstice between cells, bubbles</P>

<P>and elements</P>

<P>it flows lighter than water</P>

<P>through all that</P>

<P>giggles in your ear and screams when you can't</P>

<P>making conversation troublesome</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>paradox finials turbines change</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>if you want to hear the poem in the air</P>

<P>there is a piece of skylight</P>

<P>you can hear</P>

<P>and you have a word in your hand</P>

<P>caught like a firefly</P>

<P>an image</P>

<P>glowing between your fingers</P>

<P>hear it through your eyes</P>

<P>in its angle</P>

<P>tangent current waves</P>

<P>December, Dialectics and Physics</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>-- 60 minute universe</P>

<P>the physics of the art dialectic</P>

<P>newton's random apple eve</P>

<P>science contemplating the mind</P>

<P>the mind contemplating itself</P>

<P>like the flow where the</P>

<P>scientist can't know the frontier</P>

<P>of the brain juice</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>a string of cubes where each year lives</P>

<P>where each movie is a grain of sand</P>

<P>compared to the whole of experience</P>

<P>which is carried forward unum</P>

<P>hourglass timeglass cubes</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>the dialectic of philosophy and art</P>

<P>when the art is part of the soul</P>

<P>and the soul breathes experience</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>but the artists lived in different centuries</P>

<P>they just missed each other</P>

<P>somehow they converse</P>

<P>originate and respond</P>

<P>what bursts original and what from the</P>

<P>hearing senses absorbing</P>

<P>avant garde, native and movement(s)</P>

<P>libraries holding voices dry with spines</P>

<P>galleries present associations through your eyes</P>

<P>magnify silence and sounds in response</P>

<P>like fragments from the depths of the subconscious</P>

<P>coming through the wire</P>

<P>or colonial mirrors of the payors in fine paint</P>

<P>el greco showing their eyes soulful</P>

<P>cortazar speaking from the side of the bench photo</P>

<P>curls and spirals in his words himself</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>a pearl is formed of an outline with one crescendo</P>

<P>decrescendo creche, Jesus is born of a December second where joy
lives, an instant,</P>

<P>a grain of sand, a grain of saint, a piece of salt, saltpeter
peace</P>

<P>love mixed with all the pain of all those who have died for
nothing, nothing?</P>

<P>and the love is perfect compost</P>

<P>wherein new babies form pearl bubbles at breasts</P>

<P>yet it weighs</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>incandescent the sky in winter broken opalescent lavender ices</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>the winter glaze in doom's eyes is shock still milk curdled
cold</P>

<P>and something still still survives</P>

<P>it is ghosts living within you amid laughter and traffic
gurgling</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>a leaf falls spiralling with variable factors: mass, shape,</P>

<P>position on limb, angle on limb, gravity,</P>

<P>air current on start, currents during fall,</P>

<P>this barring people, cars, tree limbs, other leaves, chance</P>

<P>the odd candelabra</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>as light as smoke, as heavy as that smoke from a cigarette slowly
spirals</P>

<P>hangs in the air,</P>

<P>and falls, your breath into it steady creates a lower stream</P>

<P>which causes smoke to</P>

<P>stretch itself and curl like a cat's back,</P>

<P>or suddenly like a thoughtstream snaps --</P>

<P>a snowflake melts --</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>smooth birds</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>sea's constant variations</P>

<P>smooth birds grab sandtracks</P>

<P>without jostling the horizontal</P>
