<P>cool</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>it was yesterday</P>

<P>in an ice cube</P>

<P>when I saw them in the ice.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>when I looked up from the ice water</P>

<P>everyone was singing the same</P>

<P>empty song, as if they didn't</P>

<P>know what time it was.</P>

<P>I couldn't tell if I was alone.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I disappeared, looking at their hands</P>

<P>as they walked</P>

<P>carefully along the beach.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>they took my hand</P>

<P>and I felt my breath</P>

<P>catch in the cold.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>they took me to John Muir's ghost</P>

<P>sitting on a tree stump</P>

<P>and his eyes were full of fields,</P>

<P>tears, and lost valleys,</P>

<P>rushing water.</P>

<P>he took us to California</P>

<P>(we had a great time.)</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I looked out again from the ice cube.</P>

<P>just to make sure.</P>

<P>and I shivered</P>

<P>as they looked</P>

<P>at the empty bar stool blankly,</P>

<P>but no one really seemed</P>

<P>to notice.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>they forgot the rule of flight, in madness:</P>

<P>the truth</P>

<P>could not be priced</P>

<P>beauty</P>

<P>could not be bartered</P>

<P>for the reality of flowers</P>

<P>or how fun sex was</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>before the ocean was polluted</P>

<P>and everything wild</P>

<P>died</P>

<P>and all the money was worth</P>

<P>less than the trees it was</P>

<P>made of</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>he took one last look at the ocean.</P>

<P>his hand closed over hers.</P>

<P>their hair was long</P>

<P>like a luxury, like fields.</P>

<P>it blew in the wind and</P>

<P>they watched the waves</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>and</P>

<P>moonlight</P>

<P>was all that was left,</P>

<P>glittering on the surf.</P>

<P>keeping warm by staying close.</P>

<P>the concrete and glass was</P>

<P>cool on their backs.</P>

<P>sharing the rest of the air,</P>

<P>the water.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>looking up for a planet</P>

<P>to jump to</P>

<P>among all those bright stars</P>

<P>they could no longer see</P>

<P>after the telescopes exploded.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>words</P>

<P>one</P>

<P>at a time</P>

<P>yes</P>

<P>no</P>

<P>sometimes maybe they spoke</P>

<P>each other's names,</P>

<P>mostly</P>

<P>they held hands.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>the winds blew them away.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>everyone seemed so blind,</P>

<P>so very</P>

<P>cool.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>one last look at the ocean</P>

<P>Play Dead</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>roll over, wheeler dealer time,</P>

<P>flick a brick into a spot of crime,</P>

<P>singe the sparkles in her eyes,</P>

<P>sparks from her flying surgeon wild mind,</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>... cut, while sleeping, winking, fatally,</P>

<P>seventeen and thirty-two dozen,</P>

<P>million-ten silences, scalpels</P>

<P>frozen axle spokes, ruby-studded axes slice</P>

<P>into a single greeting card rainbow,</P>

<P>the gleeful gnome frolicking underneath,</P>

<P>glittering simple man, embracing the</P>

<P>fetid charm of hot pink, and fully-lined,</P>

<P>straight jackets blowing across a glowing emerald lawn,</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>glinting gumdrop eyelids flower on the sugar-coated screen,</P>

<P>throw them magic money for tasting Mr. Clean,</P>

<P>selling six slick sex scandals with the twist of some hip,</P>

<P>or the slant of her mouth on a zesty chicken wing</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>freed from the flaming obelisk yet draped in stinking tar</P>

<P>the golden flea he leadeth thee, he bleeding in the sunshine</P>

<P>at twenty-three for free, roll over, quite dead the nimble</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>mind,</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Do you mind?</P>

<P>week</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>she eats flowers on Tuesdays, blue ones, otherwise she doesn't
care</P>

<P>her eyes turn blue, flown away the petals, sparks from her
tongue</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>she wakes up late Wednesdays and of course years wondering where
she has</P>

<P>dreamed and where she was real, asleep in her screams, tears the
sheets of</P>

<P>paper from her dandelion body without a wish</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Thursdays she reads the sky-winds, listens to all clouds, nibbling
on her</P>

<P>fingers like a squirrel who knows the storm, scatters up her mind
to look</P>

<P>across and down, up without ground</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>the petals are so dry by Friday and on curbs and corners she sells
them as</P>

<P>feathers to tourists</P>

<P>to whom everything quaint has a price</P>

<P>and she dance, and she dance, and dance until she float</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Saturday her lover haunts her past but does not find her diamonds
and her</P>

<P>breasts they bud for him and she swell and bloom with blood</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Sundays all is dream of youth and maybe her fruit thrive and</P>

<P>fall into their mouth with truth</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>the ice of Monday chills her through to sap,</P>

<P>before they leave they burn the harvest remaining,</P>

<P>and he leave her writhing with loss</P>

<P>in the flame of his mouths the vision smelted into blade</P>

<P>for the pruning of her deaths, counter of her cycle</P>
