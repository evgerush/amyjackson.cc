<P>after school and summer</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>the program is</P>

<P>a place for them to go</P>

<P>after school and summer</P>

<P>they are reading, quiet</P>

<P>listening to music</P>

<P>when I come in</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>they love to shout</P>

<P>they got caught in the</P>

<P>rain and the building</P>

<P>shook with their laughter</P>

<P>when they ran in</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>we used to be downstairs</P>

<P>next to them</P>

<P>trying to work amid their</P>

<P>raucous energy</P>

<P>now we're upstairs</P>

<P>and their voices come</P>

<P>up to us throughout the day</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>she said it was hard at first</P>

<P>opening up year after year</P>

<P>to new love for new children</P>

<P>transient with their families</P>

<P>but now it's been going on</P>

<P>so long, they've come back</P>

<P>she invites them for</P>

<P>Christmas</P>

<P>and she feels better</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>It was like that with the</P>

<P>refugees, four groups in</P>

<P>one summer, so hard to</P>

<P>open up each time to each</P>

<P>one, knowing they would</P>

<P>go soon</P>

<P>but they had so much pain</P>

<P>to escape from</P>

<P>our hearts helped them</P>

<P>feel it, get it out</P>

<P>get ready for the asylum</P>

<P>interview</P>

<P>until they could tell their</P>

<P>reasons for leaving</P>

<P>without losing it</P>

<P>by the end learning to laugh</P>

<P>again with us</P>

<P>each time breaking fresh</P>

<P>a balancing of hope and</P>

<P>memory, trauma, simple</P>

<P>summer, mangos, pupusas</P>

<P>flattened pat between the palms</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>they said feel the</P>

<P>rhythm in your feet</P>

<P>and dance up from</P>

<P>there</P>

<P>it worked</P>

<P>my hips found the beat</P>

<P>dancing all night</P>

<P>we forgot</P>

<P>Sylvio</P>

<P>for a while</P>

<P>the silver roof shone</P>

<P>fathom Absalom</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>the bus would leave taking</P>

<P>them to Canada</P>

<P>the residents had stopped</P>

<P>crying years before</P>

<P>we volunteers couldn't</P>

<P>contain it</P>

<P>the windows of the bus</P>

<P>should have cracked</P>

<P>with so much pain</P>

<P>but it was joy, too</P>

<P>we knew we had also</P>

<P>found that</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>some of the children</P>

<P>have a hard time with eyes</P>

<P>they look at my eyes for</P>

<P>a long time, until something</P>

<P>breaks and they realize that</P>

<P>I'm smiling at them and then</P>

<P>a smile returned in disbelief</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I see three girls reaching</P>

<P>to touch the different colored</P>

<P>people holding hands around</P>

<P>the world</P>

<P>this week there are pictures</P>

<P>of them playing in fountains</P>

<P>and wrestling</P>

<P>some shy smiles</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>later, i see the same three girls</P>

<P>don't be pushing people so hard</P>

<P>they almost fought about it</P>

<P>at the foot of the stairs</P>

<P>I was coming down and they</P>

<P>pulled into themselves and she</P>

<P>said again don't be</P>

<P>pushing people so hard and</P>

<P>turned away</P>

<P>dizzy and repeating it again to</P>

<P>herself, almost hitting the</P>

<P>wall with her shoulder</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I walked in to take them the rent</P>

<P>check, and he caught my eye at</P>

<P>four feet or so and I smiled and</P>

<P>he said beauty, emphasizing the</P>

<P>T, oh thanks, I said, dizzy myself</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>there's one girl who gets lost in a</P>

<P>stare, stood on the stairs in front</P>

<P>of me not moving, lost, her finger</P>

<P>pointing at nothing below her</P>

<P>takes a while for people to get</P>

<P>in to her, let them in, get out</P>

<P>to them</P>

<P>I understand that</P>

<P>give her what simple faith I can</P>

<P>eventually her eyes come back</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>it's like the man last week in DC</P>

<P>he was speaking out his poetry</P>

<P>extemporaneously, while the</P>

<P>other man was stringing</P>

<P>caf&eacute; lights</P>

<P>I caught his eye and smiled</P>

<P>walking by</P>

<P>he stopped and said thank you</P>

<P>for the smile to my back</P>

<P>sure, man, i said</P>

<P>I was glad to give him that</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Back on the Metro</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>full of</P>

<P>samosas aloo pratha</P>

<P>aloo gobi chicken tikka masala</P>

<P>the rice custard that makes us smile</P>

<P>warm and sleepy</P>

<P>back on the Metro</P>

<P>the cars are pulled</P>

<P>along the spine of the train</P>

<P>like vertebrae</P>

<P>shifting with the effort</P>

<P>forward</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>the cables of the inner walls</P>

<P>are racing gray arteries</P>

<P>sudden black lights blue</P>

<P>arteries again</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>my head on your shoulder</P>

<P>the rock of the train</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>with god's tired voice mumbling the stops</P>

<P>all the way to Union Station</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>the summer after the tornado</P>

<P>cubes and spirals</P>

<P>sudden rainbows</P>

<P>sudden winds</P>

<P>twice i went in and</P>

<P>the news was caution</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>one cloud was like a Japanese</P>

<P>box kite made of currents</P>

<P>grays and speed</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>one a blanket of clouds quilted</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>and then a large flat disc arced</P>

<P>cut into the sky</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>two smaller</P>

<P>clouds</P>

<P>one spiralling</P>

<P>one being stretched down</P>

<P>falling opalescent</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>II.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>bumblebee paths</P>

<P>deep blue umbels and</P>

<P>pollen</P>

<P>bells</P>

<P>and the bumblebee is disappearing</P>

<P>into foxglove throats</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>a hummingbird came to the</P>

<P>sunflower arch and was tiny</P>

<P>and reigned</P>

<P>brightly its eyes surveyed</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>i was still by the cariopteris</P>

<P>listening to the bees there close</P>

<P>and the hummingbird's lightest buzz</P>

<P>fast and squeaked sharply bright green</P>

<P>and for an instant i saw it closer</P>

<P>startling us both</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>then to sit again on the arch</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>i couldn't turn</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>then to fly away</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>and the small birds yellow</P>

<P>with black markings</P>

<P>ate the seeds out of the</P>

<P>echinacea</P>

<P>a flock of five rare birds</P>

<P>there twice in a morning</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>to know that i had</P>

<P>given them some respite</P>

<P>in exchange for what they had given me!</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>III.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>like photographs each night</P>

<P>held still against nightmare fragments</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>black butterflies at noon</P>

<P>swallowtails on coneflowers</P>

<P>purple stars facing orange up</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>IV.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>leaves making sound textures</P>

<P>of silk or soft meeting soft air</P>
