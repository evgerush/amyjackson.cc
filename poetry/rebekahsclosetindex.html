  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><font color="#FFCCFF">Rebekah&rsquo;s Closet</font></em><font color="#FFCCFF">, is the first book by Amy Jackson</font></font><font color="#FFCCFF">.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCCFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The novel, <em>Rebekah&rsquo;s Closet</em>, the cover acrylic painting<br> 
  (see thumbnail image above) of which was created especially <br>
  for the book by Jackson, is based on her true story growing up <br>
  with child sexual and physical abuse in her family, and learning <br>
  not only to survive it, but to overcome and transform it <br>
  through various forms of creativity. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCCFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The book describes Rebekah&rsquo;s journey throughout her life <br>
  to discover her adventurous and dark, creative and dangerous sides, <br>
  and like Persephone, she must explore the depths before <br>
  she can come through to the Light and find her own balance<br> 
  among the more than twenty personalities she is left to live with, <br>
  to somehow create a wholeness out of her extremely fragmented self.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFCCFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition, there are sublime passages of beauty, time travel, <br>
  poetry, escapades with luminaries such as Voltaire, Thomas Jefferson <br>
  and the mysterious Strange Man &ndash; and the leaders Rebekah seeks &ndash;<br> 
  the poet kings! For Rebekah seeks not only to heal herself, <br>
  not to find vengeance against her abusers, but to heal <br>
  the troubled world around her, ultimately, to somehow bring about <br>
  global peace and bliss before the Millennium, in any way she can.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#FFFF00" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This poignantly written novel follows the main character on her incredibly <br>
      brave journey as she attempts to build a new life while fighting <br>
      the ghosts of her past. Although heartbreaking at times to read <br>
      due to the reader's immediate affinity with the primary character, <br>
      <em>Rebekah's Closet</em> is a beautifully written book full of raw <br>
      emotion and exquisite sensory details.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFF00" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The reader is transported to wonderful places <br>
      where the surroundings can be seen, felt and smelled - <br>
      whether is it a quaint caf&eacute; in France, or a sultry tropical jungle, <br>
      Ms. Jackson does a wonderful job describing, <br>
      in vivid detail, every aspect of the environment. <br>
      After reading this book, I feel that I have gained a <br>
      greater insight into both the challenges and resiliency <br>
      of children who face abuse and the ways in which healing <br>
      can occur when one opens their heart to new experiences.<br> 
      I look forward to reading more books written <br>
      by this very talented author.</font><font color="#FFFF00">&quot; <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Cyndi LaChapelle</font></font> </p>

        <font color="#FF8000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Amy's book is one of the best novels I've read in awhile. <br>
      Being from the same school and town as Amy, <br>
      she placed me back in the same era as she was writing. <br>
      I could clearly see myself sitting in one of the classrooms <br>
      at Cartersville High School. Her detailed description was impeccable. <br>
      I was even able to envision Paris through her eyes. <br>
      A truly talented artist, Amy is an upcoming Best Selling Author <br>
      to keep your eyes on. Well done, Amy!&quot;</font> <font color="#FF8000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Kathy McStatts-Fulton</font><br>

      <p><font color="#00FFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This beautifully written novel by Ms. Jackson takes the reader on journeys, <br>
      both physical and of the mind. It creates a beautiful doubt about what <br>
      is possible in the world. This is all achieved through being allowed <br>
      to follow the main character through her journey of healing and <br>
      transformation while working away from horrible abuse in her early <br>
      upbringing and through some failed relationships. We watch as Rebekah<br> 
      struggles through life and ultimately finds a place of peace. <br>
      This is sometimes painful as the author pulls you deeply into <br>
      the characters world and life. It is worth the effort though as you <br>
      leave the book feeling rejuvenated and whole.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#00FFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ms. Jackson is able to take the reader to places deep in the imagination <br>
      of the main character and through the lovely streets of Paris as well. <br>
      It is a journey worth the time and exploration. It is tough to face <br>
      some of the abuse imposed on the main character but leads one<br> 
      to understand the true nature of love and resiliency in children <br>
      who have suffered abuse and indeed in all of us. I can only <br>
      hope that future efforts by Ms. Jackson are in the works, as this<br> 
      is as fine a first novel I have had the pleasure of reading.</font><font color="#00FFFF">&quot;<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> -- Jason Stelluto </font></font><br>
