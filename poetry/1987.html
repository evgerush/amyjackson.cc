<P>shadows lightly the white double-wide trailer,</P>

<P>black bird-stars spooked together, away,</P>

<P>always always always</P>

<P>you on top of me</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I've watched you I've watched the words</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>each held and fastened down with utmost ease</P>

<P>to the insides of my dreams there to wait there to</P>

<P>wait until a perfect wing touch perfect trap string</P>

<P>and run quick to tie me</P>

<P>the poison fang of your words in my ear</P>

<P>to still the form to faint, sleep, die without</P>

<P>dying</P>

<P>from her dream-hearing</P>

<P>like a yesterday-mouth</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>called or sang or spoke in foreign note to her it did</P>

<P>in a blue-spangled monastery-circus long-faced stranger dream</P>

<P>from the tip, from on top of his bleeding-crowned fallen head</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>it cried: music-triumph! (and piercing</P>

<P>truth with orange</P>

<P>open-flame beak)</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>and saw her, with one bead-ball-god-moon-eye</P>

<P>The sand buries my edges.</P>

<P>You only know I'm just a piece if you bend</P>

<P>down to look to reach some sunburnt</P>

<P>fingers and pull me out.</P>

<P>If you happen to be fond of pieces</P>

<P>you could carry me along awhile as you</P>

<P>kick the sea away from your feet ...</P>

<P>you might fling me away, back into the blue,</P>

<P>Soup</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>it takes all day for my Mother to make soup--</P>

<P>parboils a chicken, skims the fat off the top, chills the</P>

<P>stock, pulls the skin off the bones-- throws the bones</P>

<P>away, wishbone and all-- gives the skin to the cat--</P>

<P>makes a little chicken salad for lunch--</P>

<P>takes the cold fat off the stock with a</P>

<P>wooden spoon, pours it over the chicken in a</P>

<P>big stainless steel pot--</P>

<P>with black stains on the bottom</P>

<P>where she burned the chili one winter--</P>

<P>adds water to the broth, a little salt, a little pepper--</P>

<P>cuts up what she feels like putting in--</P>

<P>in the summer it's fresh okra, tomatoes, green beans, celery--</P>

<P>in the winter it's canned English peas, canned tomatoes,
carrots</P>

<P>from the grocery store, celery--</P>

<P>and lets it all cook slowly all afternoon--</P>

<P>puts the rice or the noodles in last--</P>

<P>puts in on high for about</P>

<P>15 minutes, stirring it every now and then, turns it</P>

<P>down to medium--</P>

<P>which is 6 or 7 on the new stove--</P>

<P>tastes the soup, seasons it if it needs it,</P>

<P>but usually it's perfect--</P>

<P>although Daddy puts a lot of salt on his (he</P>

<P>doesn't really like soup)</P>

<P>I put a little if I think it needs it--</P>

<P>Mother doesn't put any salt on hers--</P>

<P>she loves a good bowl of soup</P>

<P>with saltines.</P>

<P>talking to the spiders about technique,</P>

<P>with her back to it, making lace and memories</P>

<P>curses, charms, out of nothing out of</P>

<P>string out of herself</P>

<P>Maybe it was because it begged her to lace her long witch fingers
in the</P>

<P>threads, dye them, pull them into pastel exotic</P>

<P>bizarre opalescent</P>

<P>black and mescaline brights</P>

<P>weave them into friendship bracelets</P>

<P>lover's necklace, family ties.</P>

<P>Maybe it was because it had been so</P>

<P>long, the thread of something always falling into her hands,
snaking,</P>

<P>spiralling out of the ceiling, the walls, the floor from the earth
beneath</P>

<P>and beyonds, a plural of infinities,</P>

<P>connection.</P>

<P>Maybe it was because it had been so long</P>

<P>since it had been anything like dreams ...</P>

<P>Sylvia Plath</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>there's a purple line at the edge of the gray</P>

<P>placid sky. like then. you used to say that it was the</P>

<P>color of a woman you'd never seen, but would like to</P>

<P>know. would like to be. would like to have been.</P>

<P>you are that color memory to me now when i see</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>it's really not purple. not burgundy. wine. it is</P>

<P>you, even though your color was charcoal. ash.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>sometimes i would think you threw that color up there</P>

<P>on purpose, to defy my words, my</P>

<P>metaphors. you do a lot of things like that.</P>

<P>did. still do. will forever.</P>

<P>ash. no, not wine.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>the color is past, insipid as the gray, like a life.</P>

<P>yours, ended,</P>

<P>arms folded under your soft head, your hard</P>

<P>head in the gas oven.</P>

<P>you knelt there, took a dry laugh,</P>

<P>slept with the fumes on</P>

<P>but not lit, your soul floating,</P>

<P>regretting the ceiling.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>the streetlights flick on schedule, inept, but</P>

<P>they find you dead and blue, of all things, a</P>

<P>dead blue poet,</P>

<P>disguising the rift between your life, mine.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>night, it is coming, with charcoal</P>

<P>toes, illegible,</P>

<P>eating the horizon.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>the mate</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>maybe like crickets you dance</P>

<P>well not exactly like crickets</P>

<P>but in summertime's hot nights</P>

<P>one was always calling out for a mate</P>

<P>in the hall, between the walls</P>

<P>rubs its legs together</P>

<P>howls like a dog after a siren</P>

<P>except the pain wasn't in its senses</P>

<P>or the sound</P>

<P>but a methodical loneliness</P>

<P>it drove me crazy and I turned the</P>

<P>light on in the black hallway</P>

<P>rub my eyes</P>

<P>stomp the old yellow carpet</P>

<P>with angry sleepy feet</P>

<P>and gone</P>

<P>gone gone he was</P>

<P>maybe like crickets</P>

<P>and there goes my peripheral</P>

<P>vision of you</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>touches bed the morning (a fantasy)</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>across chest, the hair, long</P>

<P>glowing lightly golden-brown</P>

<P>flowing to its tips</P>

<P>just short of a rib</P>

<P>breathing young woman</P>

<P>near, so near, asleep.</P>

<P>between his fingertips</P>

<P>twirling strands of hair.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>the arm, gentle,</P>

<P>the hand over rib</P>

<P>holding breath and beat</P>

<P>beneath, bonded.</P>

<P>breathing woman asleep,</P>

<P>beside, calm.</P>

<P>between his fingers</P>

<P>short, light-brown hair</P>

<P>of her head, fingertips</P>

<P>tracing scalp, slowly</P>

<P>so not to wake her</P>

<P>from her dreams</P>

<P>so real.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The wine hurts deep.</P>

<P>I feel your slumbered memory, there.</P>

<P>I touch the warmth, the taste of blood in my mouth,</P>

<P>the rippling pain of your faces,</P>

<P>the unforgiving eyes.</P>

<P>I do not recoil. I laugh; bubbles slowly</P>

<P>gurgle to my breath without joy.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The wine cures deep.</P>

<P>I forgive myself and you. There is</P>

<P>joy seeping through.</P>
