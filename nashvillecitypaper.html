          Parting can be such sweet sorrow. Sometimes it can be caffeinated too,<br>
          especially when you say goodbye from one of Nashville&#146;s favorite 
          coffee shops. <br>
          Amy Jackson, a local artist who only recently came onto the scene, is 
          leaving<br>
          Nashville for D.C., but is holding one final showing of her brilliant 
          photography<br>
          work at Fido in Hillsboro Village.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A self-proclaimed poet who 
          played with photography and painting a good part of<br>
          her life, Jackson got serious about her art work in &#146;93. &quot;I 
          had been experiencing a<br>
          lot of chronic pain due to a jaw dysfunction (TMJ),&quot; she said. 
          &quot;I started to paint<br>
          because I needed to express myself. I couldn&#146;t make facial expressions 
          or talk. I<br>
          had to keep my stress level really low because it&#146;s a stress-related 
          condition.<br>
          Painting helped.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Along with painting, Jackson 
          delved deeper into her photography. &quot;I&#146;ve taken a lot<br>
          of bad rolls of film,&quot; she admitted. &quot;[My training] has been 
          completely trial and<br>
          error. I would take pictures of things I like. If I find something fascinating, 
          I would<br>
          get really close to it. After &#146;93, I started using photography 
          as a way to capture<br>
          things that looked like paintings. I think they started to influence 
          each other.&quot;<br>
          In 1995, Jackson moved to Nashville and continued to paint and dabble 
          in<br>
          photography, though it took her until 2000 to begin to feel confident 
          enough to<br>
          approach local galleries for showings. ruby green gave her a chance 
          with a series<br>
          of images taken at the Chilton&#146;s Industrial Machine Shop featuring 
          subject matter<br>
          like rusted-out industrial machinery and metal plates, 15-foot drills 
          with cryptic<br>
          writing on them, and piled up drill bits and metal shavings. The items 
          could never<br>
          be identified at the angles and depth of field taken, thus creating 
          enchanting,<br>
          nearly abstract pieces. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I look for beauty in 
          odd places and in things that other people think are junk. I<br>
          love the randomness in the Chilton series,&quot; Jackson commented. 
          <br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another collection of images, 
          which more closely reflects her background in<br>
          painting, includes a series of broken glass pictures. Some are natural 
          and others<br>
          digitally enhanced, producing the visual essence of a watercolor painting. 
          &quot;Mostly<br>
          I&#146;m just playing with the light, the brightness and the contrast. 
          It brings out all this<br>
          random stuff you wouldn&#146;t think was there.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jackson&#146;s farewell show 
          at Fido will feature never-before-seen images from these<br>
          two collections. She hopes to continue developing her connections to 
          local<br>
          galleries for future exhibitions in the coming years.<br>
          </font></p>
