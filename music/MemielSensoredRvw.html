    Memiel <br>
    Spoken word and jazz CD <br>
    Words and Painting by Amy Jackson <br>
    Review by Brecca Theele, Sensored Magazine (<a href="http://www.sensored.com">sensored.com</a>), 
    Nashville, TN</font>
  <P align="left"><font face="Skia"><br>
    I sit at my desk here at work and review the envelope handed to me last night. 
    My first impression is positive. The title, Memiel, is interesting. The artist, 
    Amy Jackson, put together a great package. The cover art is beautiful, with 
    an<br>
    author bio, history of Memiel, resume, and lyrics all printed out. I put on 
    my headphones and dive into my work, ready to listen. </font>
  <P align="left"><font face="Skia">Nice beginning, it is like wine before dinner. 
    I enjoy the music and close my eyes. I see a woman by the sound of Jackson&#146;s 
    voice. Long yet small, soft yet confident, I began to paint my own image. 
    French poetry, oozing off of long sax<br>
    notes. Wait a minute, my mood is changing. My heart is beginning to pound. 
    My palms are sweaty. Eyes open. Stop: the sound and the beat is rupturing 
    me. I am looking around embarrassed; I am at work. I think to breathe, I close 
    my<br>
    eyes, and tell myself to enjoy this bliss. I am taken in, sold to continue 
    on. </font>
  <P align="left"><font face="Skia">Oooh, the music. I am alive, I am woman, I 
    am sensual, I am. I could go on and on. I am being seduced by the sound, taking 
    time to enjoy the lure of what is next. I feel that I am being pulled in farther 
    and farther, yet so willingly; I go with no reluctance. </font>
  <P align="left"><font face="Skia">I am no longer thinking in sentences, just 
    beats. The heat in my body is very apparent now, I feel it through my limbs 
    to my toes; I am ready to succumb to the idea of sensual pleasure, ready for 
    the ride. The music is taking me to all my most idealistic sensual experiences. 
    Hot, bothered, beat, and rhythm, I am a diva. It comes to an end and with 
    the push of a button I can fall in love again and again. </font>
  <P align="left"><font face="Skia">I call my husband on the phone to tell him 
    I will be home tonight. I have to take deep breaths to come down from the 
    experience. <br>
    Next, I call Amy Jackson. I have to talk to the originator. She is amazing, 
    so ready to share the creative process. The piece Memiel came from a tough 
    period in her life. She was experiencing chaos, fragments of the feelings 
    love could offer in an idealistic world. Memiel is Jackson&#146;s attempt 
    to create the experience of that idealistic love. From the slow, luring start 
    to the idea of never ending, Amy wrote the lyrics before she ever experienced 
    longevity in a relationship. For the first time in a long while I got the 
    artist intention just by hearing the piece. To experience love by slowly getting 
    in the mood, to the crescendo of the senses, Amy Jackson and Memiel take you 
    there. </font>
  <P align="left"><font face="Skia">After performing the poem as spoken word at 
    Bean Central&#146;s &quot;Poetry at the Bean,&quot; Jackson and producer/engineer 
    Jason Stelluto of Windowpane Productions worked to set it to music. Jackson 
    charted what she heard in different sessions, and Stelluto gathered the composer 
    and musicians. Blending a mix of Latin, jazz and hip hop, composer Karl Straub 
    has translated Jackson&#146;s chart into a flowing but chaotic and sensual 
    score, evocative of Charles Mingus and Astor Piazolla. Obviously Jackson&#146;s 
    words did it for me, but without Straub and Stelluto, her words are far less 
    powerful. You can purchase Memiel CD at Turtles on West End for $11.</font>
