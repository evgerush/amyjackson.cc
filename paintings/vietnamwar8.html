    This painting was ultimately and literally a turning point for the series and is subtitled &ldquo;Purgatory.&rdquo; <br>
    Initially the color scheme was developed to symbolize the especially mixed Lime green <br>
    to the far left and in the center, as overtaking the Death and darkness of the Jungle <br>
    to the far right and center. However, as work began intensely to complete the<br>
Jungle sections, or stained glass window sections, an entirely different sense <br>
of the piece and the series developed. A time tunnel of a sort, from childhood to <br>
adult came through the series, and a need arose naturally, to gain a new perspective <br>
on the whole body of work. The vision for the culmination of the series in the <br>
last two paintings developed, as Hell, and Heaven on Earth. <br>
<br>
This piece is subtitled Purgatory: Grief. During the painting of this work Jackson <br>
allowed herself to Wikipedia the number of people who died after Saigon fell<br>
and she added that to those who had died during the Viet-Nam War<br>
and those who had died in all the wars around the world<br>
and in World Wars I and II</P>
  <P>and she became overcome, anguished by all that loss of life in wars.<br>
    She decided that if you fought a war it had better be worth fighting for.<br>
    It had better be worth it.<br>
    <br>
    She found in Wikipedia somewhere that the Allies in WWII had agreed<br>
    DURING the war upon the Four Freedoms that they were fighting for:<br>
    <br>
    Freedom of Speech * Freedom of Worship * Freedom from Want * Freedom from Fear<br>
    <br>
    And Jackson thought of those in the local and global context now<br>
  and how naturally they seem to fit something we could agree upon.</P>
  <P>Who can say?<br>
    But doesn't that sound like Democracy?<br>
    <br>
  So the series began to be about a lot of things beyond war.</P>
  <P>From grief and loss, to clarity and philosophy.<br>
