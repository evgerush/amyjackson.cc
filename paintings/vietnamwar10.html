    Hope.<br>
    I do.<br>
    But hope is not inaction; it is action. <br>
    It is voting and speaking your mind in the free world <br>
    for those who are not yet free.<br>
    For it is not enough to have a free economy<br>
  one must be truly free.</P>
  <P>In WWII the leaders of the &quot;free world&quot;, the Allies,<br>
    decided to agree before the war was over<br>
    upon the Four Freedoms: <br>
  Freedom of Speech * Freedom of Worship * Freedom from Want * and * Freedom from Fear ...</P>
  <P>That astounds me. How very heroic and decent of them.<br>
    True leadership for the world even then.<br>
    <br>
  That is worth fighting for.</P>
  <P>Civil liberties, the right to vote, The Bill of Rights, <br>
    The International Rule of Law:<br>
    I believe in the foundation and leadership of all <br>
    of these fundamental rights.<br>
    <br>
  I believe everyone on Earth has the inherent right to them.</P>
  <P>Maybe because I was born with them, I believe that <br>
    everyone else should have them.<br>
    Maybe because I was born seeing the ravages<br>
    of the Civil War in Georgia<br>
  the Trail of  Tears<br>
  WWI<br>
  WWII<br>
  Viet-Nam</P>
  <P>There has been too much death now.</P>
  <P>I believe we are headed for something good and true.<br>
    <br>
    We have learned enough now to know upon what basic things we can agree.
<br>
    <br>
    I believe the culmination of this series, the Viet-Nam War series<br>
  is about Peace on Earth for me.</P>
  <P>Not death and war ultimately, but about Peace.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>You have to realize why people  fought, why people fight</P>
  <P>and what is worth fighting for.<br>
    <br>
    Going forward. Peace is a choice. Don't waste it.<br>
    <br>
    ~ Namaste ~
