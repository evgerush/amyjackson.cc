    Hell on Earth is the subtitle of this painting which has as its major inspiration<br>
    the splitting of the atom for the atomic bomb. This was iconic for Jackson<br>
  growing up in the 1960s and during the 1980s during the Cold War. Then<br>
  again during the discussion of the Iran deal in 2015, the threat of nuclear war<br>
  and weapons again are at issue, circling and cycling. </P>
  <P>At the top is the mushroom cloud of a distorted Rain Forest canopy. It symbolizes a Nature<br>
    that is in distress. From gene splicing, some of which is okay, some of which has<br>
    gone too far -- to climate control issues, of which we all know, eh?<br>
    It's like the situation is not under control. Or, needs addressing, for I do believe<br>
    Nature when well stewarded, and then left alone, well, both, knows quite well <br>
    how to heal and regenerate herself/itself.    </P>
  <P>You'll see new colors on this one, the gold, the silver and the cream, for the <br>
    expenses of the war budget and the resources diverted toward the military <br>
    worldwide.
    <br>
    <br>
    As the bomb cloud spirals, the base itself depicts for Jackson the art deco artists' <br>
    camouflage of WWI shipping and travel liners before the US entry into the war,<br>
    for fear of German U-boats, before the Lusitania was sunk. The black base<br>
    of the bomb cloud is death itself, and contains one lost heart for <br>
    all the lost hearts it spells for all of the wars ...<br>
    <br>
    for why at this point in all the warring have so many died<br>
    in Viet-Nam alone?<br>
    genocides?<br>
    world wars?<br>
    and I believe strongly in a secure defense against Hitlers and ISIS types<br>
    and those against civil liberties and international rule of law<br>
    because I am born into a democracy<br>
    and for me freedom is peace</P>
  <P>I speak my mind freely</P>
  <P>and I am a woman</P>
  <P>and I am free</P>
  <P>so I do say that although I am for a strong defense for these freedoms<br>
  the funding of the defense and the funding of basic human needs for the world's poor?<br>
  <br>
  infrastructure, education, food production, solar and wind energy?
  </P>
  <P>well, things ... priorities are a lot askew</P>
  <P>we should pay our UN dues</P>
  <P>we should do our best to de-escalate domestically in the USA and abroad</P>
  <P>show the best of democracy through work such as that The Carter Center does <br>
    by assisting with election oversight abroad and disease elimination. <br>
    It's much cheaper than
  weapons sales and more effective<br>
  and is less likely to come back to bite us in the face later.
  </P>
  <P>maybe art exchanges ... hee</P>
  <P>culinary contests ...</P>
  <P>we shall see </P>
  <P>War is a Choice; Peace is a Choice ...<br>
